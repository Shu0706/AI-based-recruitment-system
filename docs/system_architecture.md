# AI-Based Recruitment System Architecture

## Overview

The AI-Based Recruitment System is a comprehensive solution designed to automate and streamline the recruitment process. It connects job applicants with recruiters/HR administrators through an intelligent matching system powered by AI.

## System Components

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

#### Admin Portal (HR/Recruiter)
- Dashboard: Overview of recruitment activities
- Job Management: Create, edit, view, and delete job descriptions
- Candidate Management: View, filter, and sort candidates
- Resume Analysis: AI-powered insights on candidate resumes
- Matching: View AI-matched candidates for specific job roles
- Interview Scheduling: Set available time slots and manage interviews
- Analytics: Recruitment metrics and performance indicators

#### User Portal (Job Applicant)
- Dashboard: Overview of applications and statuses
- Profile Management: Update personal information and resume
- Job Search: Browse and filter available positions
- Application Tracking: Monitor application status
- Interview Management: View scheduled interviews and confirmations

### Backend (Node.js with Express)

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin vs User)
- OAuth2 integration for social logins

#### Core API Services
- User Management API
- Job Management API
- Application Management API
- Resume Management API
- Interview Scheduling API

#### AI Services
- Resume Parser: Extract structured information from resumes
- JD Parser: Extract key requirements from job descriptions
- Gap Analyzer: Identify missing information in resumes or JDs
- Matching Engine: Match candidates to job descriptions
- Recommendation Engine: Suggest top candidates for jobs

#### Integration Services
- Email Service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
- Calendar Service (Google Calendar API)
- Storage Service (File uploads and management)
- Search Service (Elasticsearch)

#### Database Services
- PostgreSQL (Relational data)
- MongoDB (Unstructured data like resumes)

## Data Flow

1. Job Applicant uploads resume → Resume Parser extracts information → Stored in database
2. Admin uploads job description → JD Parser extracts requirements → Stored in database
3. Matching Engine compares job requirements with candidate profiles → Generates matching scores
4. Admin reviews and approves candidates → Sets interview time slots
5. System schedules interviews based on FIFO → Sends notifications to candidates
6. Candidates confirm interviews → Calendar events created

## AI Agent Architecture

### Resume Parser Agent
- Input: Resume document (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Process: Uses BERT/SpaCy for NER to extract information
- Output: Structured JSON with candidate information and skills

### JD Parser Agent
- Input: Job description text
- Process: Uses BERT/SpaCy for extracting requirements and responsibilities
- Output: Structured JSON with job requirements and skills needed

### Gap Analyzer Agent
- Input: Parsed resume/JD
- Process: Compares against standard templates to identify missing information
- Output: List of missing or incomplete sections

### Matching Agent
- Input: Parsed resume and JD
- Process: Uses BERT embeddings to compute similarity scores
- Output: Match percentage and specific matching points

### Scheduling Agent
- Input: Available time slots and candidate preferences
- Process: Optimization algorithm to schedule interviews
- Output: Optimal interview schedule

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React (UI library)
- Redux (State management)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- Axios (API requests)
- React Router (Routing)

### Backend
- Node.js with Express (API server)
- JWT (Authentication)
- Multer (File uploads)
- Nodemailer with SendGrid/Mailgun (Email notifications)
- Google Calendar API (Interview scheduling)

### AI/ML
- HuggingFace Transformers (BERT)
- SpaCy (NLP)
- TensorFlow.js (ML processing)
- Word2Vec/TF-IDF (Text similarity)

### Database
- PostgreSQL (User data, job listings, applications)
- MongoDB (Resume data, unstructured information)

### DevOps
- Docker (Containerization)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- AWS/Azure/GCP (Cloud hosting)

## Security Measures

- JWT with refresh tokens
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- OWASP security best practices
- GDPR compliance for personal data
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Scalability Considerations

- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Load balancing for handling peak recruitment periods
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for heavy AI operations
- Database sharding for large-scale data
